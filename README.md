# Authorization.Core

The Authorization.Core package provides an efficient implementation of a rights-based authorization 
framework that sits on top of Microsoft's ASP.NET Core Identity Framework. The package can be used 
on its own or with the Authorization.Core.UI package to provide a rich GUI for managing your 
application's Users and Roles.

The repository's wiki describes the installation, configuration, and use of these packages.
